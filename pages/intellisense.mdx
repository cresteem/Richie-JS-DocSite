# ü§ñ Intellisense Support for Configuration
## What is Intellisense?
IntelliSense is a code-completion aid that provides intelligent code suggestions as you type. Also it includes features such as:

- **Autocomplete:** Suggestions for variables.
- **Parameter Info:** Information about parameters.
- **Quick Info:** Tooltips with documentation for the code under the cursor.
- **Option Lists:** List of options available for configuration key.
- **Error Highlighting:** Real-time detection and highlighting of syntax and semantic errors.

IntelliSense improves configuration efficiency and reduces errors by offering context-aware suggestions and documentation.

## How to enable intellisense?
We can configure Richie JS with intellisense support by making schema and configure VS Code by single command.
To do so there are two method available.
***‚ö†Ô∏è Both are only for VS Code***
